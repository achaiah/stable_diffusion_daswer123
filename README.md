# stable_diffusion_daswer123
Stable diffusion UI implementation from [daswer123](https://github.com/daswer123/stable-diffusion-colab). I had to change a few things that were broken / didn't work for me. (`<-- old implementation`)

NOTE: This setup has been greatly simplified since original release by daswer123. I have built a docker configuration to make it easy to run anywhere (locally as well as in the cloud). You can [find it here](https://github.com/achaiah/stable_diffusion_docker).
